## LLM model implementation 

### LLama 2 Model: 
An open-source language model designed for various natural language processing tasks. This model is particularly focused on supervised fine-tuning and employs a unique approach called RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). Additionally, it leverages aspects inspired by Chat GPT's training methodology to enhance its language generation capabilities.

### Features
Supervised Fine Tuning: LLama 2 is equipped for supervised fine-tuning, allowing users to tailor the model to specific tasks or domains.

RLHF Approach: The model utilizes Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, a technique that refines its performance based on feedback from human interactions.

Chat GPT Inspiration: LLama 2 draws inspiration from Chat GPT's training methodologies, incorporating lessons learned from large-scale language model training.
